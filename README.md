# Cypress Hotel Demo

This project was developed as part of a **QA Education** program, focusing on **End-to-End (E2E) test automation**.

The repository contains automated frontend tests for a hotel booking web application, simulating realistic user flows to ensure application stability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Cypress** (Core Framework)
* **JavaScript** (Scripting Language)
* **Node.js** (Runtime Environment)
* **Mocha** (Built-in Test Runner)

## 🎯 Test Coverage
* **Hotel Booking Flow:** Validation of the "Happy Path" from start to finish.
* **Form Validation:** Ensuring user inputs and booking confirmations work as expected.
* **Error Handling:** Testing edge cases and system resilience.

## 🚀 Setup & Run

Follow these steps to run the tests locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Sobhan-G/cypress-hotel-demo.git](https://github.com/Sobhan-G/cypress-hotel-demo.git)
   cd cypress-hotel-demo

   npm install

   npx cypress open

   
## Project Structure & Approach
The tests are structured to resemble real-world QA work in an agile team:

- Tests are grouped by feature and user flow
- Reusable selectors and commands are used where applicable
- Focus on readable and maintainable test cases
- Test scenarios are written from an end-user perspective

This project reflects how I approach frontend test automation in practice.
